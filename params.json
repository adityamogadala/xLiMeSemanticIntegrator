  "body": "# Welcome to xLiMe Semantic Integrator\r\n\r\nA framework developed in work page Cross-Media Semantic Intgeration (WP4) as a part of xLiMe Project (http://xlime.eu/) to collect, integrate, search and recommend different dimensions of media content (e.g. News, TV, Social Media etc.). \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n>\r\n### Search\r\n> Provides simple keyword and advanced vector-space model based search for finding relevant content in News, Social Media and TV. \t\t\t\t\t\r\n### Document Comparison\r\n> Provides monolingual and cross-lingual document comparison using monolingual and bilingual word distributed representations (i.e. embeddings).\r\n### Cross-channel Recommendations\r\n> Provides content based recommendation of the articles from different media based on input article.\r\n### Analytics\r\n> Support analytics over the content from different media stored in the repositories.\t\t\t\r\n\r\n## xLiMe Deliverables\r\n* [(D4.1) Statistical Content Linking](http://xlime.eu/images/Deliverables/xLiMe_D4.1_Statistical_Content_Linking_Prototype.pdf)\r\n* [(D4.2) Semantic Disambiguation](http://xlime.eu/images/Deliverables/xLiMe_D4.2_Semantic_Disambiguation_without_paper.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Related Publications\r\n\r\n* A.
